<p class="govuk-body-l">A journey to the Isle of Mull isn’t just about getting away. It’s about returning to yourself.</p>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">The Clarity Lab Retreat</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">Life moves fast. Too fast. And in the rush, we get stuck—trapped in old patterns, unclear on our next steps. This retreat is an intentional pause: an invitation to leave behind the noise and reconnect with what truly matters.

  Over three days, you’ll be guided through the Clarity Lab Method—a powerful, design-led approach to reframing challenges, rediscovering direction, and mapping your next chapter. And you’ll do it all in the breathtaking, elemental landscape of Scotland’s Isle of Mull.</p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What You’ll Experience</h3>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li><strong>Morning Immersion (07:00–12:00):</strong> Deep, expert-led workshops using design thinking techniques to uncover your true questions, challenge assumptions, and build a vision for your future.</li>
    <li><strong>Afternoon Exploration:</strong> Step into the wild. Hike coastal trails, explore ancient caves, or sit with your thoughts by the Atlantic. Every experience is curated to help you see your challenges with fresh eyes.</li>
    <li><strong>Evening Reflection:</strong> Gather for communal dinners prepared with fresh, locally sourced ingredients. Then, under the stars or by the fire, share insights, stories, and the discoveries of the day.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Where You’ll Stay</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">Your home for this journey is as unique as the retreat itself. Whether you choose to camp under the stars, cozy up in a yurt, or unwind in a rustic island inn, your stay is curated to match your comfort level and the season.</p>
