Great idea! The **Golden Circle approach** makes total sense for a single-page-app layout, keeping it structured while leading visitors through the emotional journey of **Why → How → What**.

Here’s a refined version of the retreat page following this structure:

## **WHY: A Retreat for Those at a Crossroads**  
_(Finding clarity starts with stepping away.)_

Life isn’t just busy; it’s noisy. We move from one thing to the next, reacting rather than choosing. **But what if you could pause?**  
What if you could **strip away distractions, immerse yourself in nature, and tap into a process designed to help you see what’s next?**  

That’s what the **Clarity Lab Retreat** is all about:  
- A chance to escape the clutter of daily life and reconnect with what truly matters.  
- A structured yet fluid space where you can rethink your direction, challenge your assumptions, and design a vision for your future.  
- An experience rooted in both **modern problem-solving methods** and the **timeless wisdom of the wild.**  

You’ll leave not just with ideas, but with a **clear path forward**—a personal roadmap for what’s next.

## **HOW: The Clarity Lab Method**  
_(Where structure meets serendipity.)_

This retreat isn’t about “finding yourself” in a vague sense. It’s about **reframing your challenges using structured design tools, while immersing yourself in nature’s energy and the wisdom of those who craft with their hands.**  

Here’s how it works:  

### **1. A Design-Led Approach to Life’s Big Questions**  
We use **design thinking**—a method used by leading companies to solve complex problems—to help you navigate your personal and professional crossroads.  
- **Morning sessions**: Deep, expert-led workshops guide you through structured reflection, challenge mapping, and future visioning.  
- **Practical exercises** help you clarify what’s blocking you, identify patterns, and create a plan for moving forward.  

### **2. The Power of Place & People**  
We believe in **energy and agency**—that clarity comes not just from thinking, but from doing and experiencing.  
- **Immerse yourself in the Isle of Mull’s raw beauty.** Hike along rugged coastlines, swim in secret mountain pools, and feel the weight of the world dissolve.  
- **Work alongside local craftspeople.** Learn ancient skills—dyeing with natural pigments, shaping materials, creating with your hands. These tactile experiences unlock new perspectives on problem-solving.  

### **3. Thoughtful Reflection & Connection**  
- **Evenings are for slowing down.** Gather for communal meals made with fresh, local ingredients.  
- Sit by the fire, under an open sky, and talk—not just about work, but about the things that truly matter.
