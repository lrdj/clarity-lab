summary: >
  This document presents a reflective post from a UK Civil Service delivery manager working in a Digital, Data, and Technology (DDaT) role. The author observes a persistent pressure to "do more with less" and "deliver faster," which often leads to immediate implementation without adequate time to critically assess if the correct problems are being addressed or if policy intentions are fully understood. How can civil service teams ensure they are solving the right problems, not just delivering quickly?
