		<p class="govuk-body"><strong>What is it?</strong> A one-hour remote coaching call that helps you kick-start the process of <em>challenging the frame</em> of what's holding you back. Whether you're wrestling with a career decision, a business challenge, or a personal transition, we’ll explore what types of things are acting against you. We'll then create a clarity checklist together, so you come away with a set of methods and actions to get you started on your transformation.</p>
