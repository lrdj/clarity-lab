		  <!-- What to Expect -->
		  <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What's this all about?</h2>
		  <p class="govuk-body">We're a small group of designers, coaches and consultants who live on a Scottish Island.</p> 

<img src="/assets/i/fionphort-pano.jpeg" style="width:100%;margin-bottom:1rem;">


		  <p class="govuk-body">We've developed a method to help teams and leaders find clarity and design their futures.</p>
		  <p class="govuk-body">We host retreats where folk come together to work through that process:

        <ul class="govuk-list cl-check">
          <li><strong>Problem space work.</strong> Mornings are spent collaboratively building maps of our problem spaces before ideating a future vision.</li>
          <li><strong>Agency through craft.</strong> In the afternoons you are paired with a local craftsperson and learn new skills while learning what you can control.</li>
          <li><strong>Being in nature.</strong> Our island is magical. Whether you're cold-water swimming, foraging for bladderwrack, or climbing a hill, this land regenerates your soul as well as your body.</li>
        </ul>

<img src="/assets/i/ben-workshop-other.png" style="width:100%;margin-bottom:1rem;">

		  <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What if I can't come to Scotland?</h2>

		  <p class="govuk-body">We realise that paying for a retreat like ours can feel expensive, and Scotland is fairly remote if you're reading this in Chicago.</p>
		  <p class="govuk-body">While nothing replaces the actual experience, we've been delivering workshops with this method for a long time, and since Covid, we've adapted the tools to work remotely. For many customers this is the way to go.</p>

		  <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">We offer two types of remote problem-space work:</h2>
	
		  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">One: The Checkpoint Session</h3>
		  <p class="govuk-body">A 1-hour remote coaching call to reframe your challenges and map a way forward. The emphasis is on building the awareness you'll need to start moving out of your "stuck" stake.</p>
	
		  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Two: The Breakthrough Workshop</h3>
		  <p class="govuk-body">The breakthrough session is like a compressed retreat. Most of the problem-space work is approached with a preparatory session and homework followed by a 2-hour online strategy session and follow-up calls and reviews afterwards. The outcome of the breakthrough is a more structured roadmap to finding your path.</p>
