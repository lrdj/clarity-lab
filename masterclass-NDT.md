One of the great challenges in this world  

**0:02**  
is knowing enough about a subject  

**0:04**  
to think you're right but not enough about the subject  

**0:10**  
to know you're wrong.  

**0:15**  
There's like a gazillion hours of me on the internet.  

**0:18**  
In almost every case, I'm talking about the universe—  

**0:21**  
black holes, the big bang, time travel, God.  

**0:24**  
What I'm going to do in this MasterClass  

**0:27**  
is teach you how to think.  

**0:29**  
The goal here is to train your mind  

**0:33**  
how to see the world differently, how  

**0:35**  
to question what others say.  

**0:38**  
I've come to realise that there are three categories of truth—  

**0:42**  
personal truth, political truths,  

**0:45**  
and the objective truths that shape our understanding  

**0:48**  
of the universe.  

**0:49**  
The interesting thing about an objective truth  

**0:51**  
is that it's true no matter what.  

**0:54**  
Imagine that.  

**0:56**  
By the time we're done, you will be  

**0:58**  
equipped with some of the methods and tools  

**1:01**  
so you can turn data into information, information  

**1:04**  
into knowledge, knowledge into wisdom.  

**1:12**  
We all have susceptibility to bias.  

**1:16**  
Search engines on the internet are the epitome of confirmation  

**1:21**  
bias, and you're going to use that as evidence  

**1:23**  
that you are correct?  

**1:25**  
No.  

**1:27**  
The good thing about science is that it's true whether or not  

**1:30**  
you believe in it.  

**1:31**  
What does it mean to be sceptical?  

**1:32**  
What does it mean to be convinced by data?  

**1:34**  
A proper sceptic questions what they're unsure  

**1:37**  
of but recognises when valid evidence is  

**1:40**  
presented to change their mind.  

**1:44**  
I will equip you to not only find objective truths  

**1:47**  
but then communicate to others how to get there.  

**1:51**  
It's not good enough to be right.  

**1:52**  
You also have to be effective.  

**1:55**  
The less connected you are to what is objectively true,  

**1:58**  
the less likely you will be able to make decisions  

**2:02**  
that will benefit your life—  

**2:04**  
your life, the life of your family, and even civilisation  

**2:07**  
itself.  

**2:09**  
I'm Neil deGrasse Tyson, and this is my MasterClass.
